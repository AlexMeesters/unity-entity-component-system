# Entity Component System

Offers a better approach to game design that allows you to concentrate on the actual problems you are solving: the data and behavior that make up your game. It leverages the C# Job System and Burst Compiler enabling you to take full advantage of today's multicore processors. By moving from object-oriented to data-oriented design it will be easier for you to reuse the code and easier for others to understand and work on it.
